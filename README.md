Code for the ABC project.

## Release status

This release includes ABC-DiT and ABC-VLA training, pretrained and
task-finetuned checkpoints, simulation and evaluation tools, real-robot
deployment, and data conversion utilities. Use `prepare.py --sim-data-list`
to see the currently published simulation datasets and
`prepare.py --sim-bundle-list` to browse available evaluation bundles.

The `abc-spd` branch additionally integrates a **Tianji/Wuji2 54-DoF SPD policy**
through the existing `train.py --policy spd` entry point, based on upstream
`cd4ca33`. See [SPD training and inference](abc_minimal/README.md#tianjiwuji2-spd)
for the real-recording contract, paper recipe, missing-camera masks, and
architecture assumptions. The branch also supports
[Tianji CPU-MuJoCo simulation rollouts](abc_minimal/README.md#tianji-simulation-rollout)
with trained SPD weights. It does not include an author-released SPD checkpoint
or a qualified Tianji hardware-control adapter.

## Repo layout

This README covers setup, a short evaluation smoke test, and training. The package READMEs below hold the full reference for their areas.

| Package | What it holds |
| --- | --- |
| [`abc_minimal/`](abc_minimal/README.md) | ABC models, dataloader, training loop, policy inference, episode tools |
| [`abc_sim/`](abc_sim/README.md) | self-contained simulator: MuJoCo scenes, task catalogue, randomization, evaluators, Gym API, sim eval |
| [`deploy/`](deploy/README.md) | real-robot deployment: local/remote inference, RTC, teleop, DAgger, recording |
| [GELLO hardware](deploy/gello/README.md) | printable parts, bill of materials, and assembly guide |

`train.py`, `eval_policy.py`, `viz_episode.py`, `viz_policy.py`, and `prepare.py` at the root are the entrypoints; `scripts/` holds the data conversion utilities.

## Setup

The training and default GPU evaluation commands below target Linux with an
NVIDIA GPU and a driver compatible with CUDA 12.8 (the pinned PyTorch build).
Use Python 3.12. The reference DiT training run uses 8 H100/H200 GPUs with
80 GB VRAM each; reduce the GPU count and per-GPU `--batch-size` for smaller
machines. Minimum evaluation VRAM has not been established.

```bash
# Install uv if you don't have it.
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

```bash
# Install ffmpeg.
sudo apt-get install -y ffmpeg     # on Linux
```

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amazon-far/abc.git
cd abc
# Pin Python and create the project venv. uv reads pyproject.toml here.
uv python pin 3.12
uv sync
```

## Quick evaluation smoke test

After setup, download the bottles checkpoint (~8.1 GB), preview data, and its
simulation assets, then run one short rollout on a single NVIDIA GPU:

```bash
uv run prepare.py --checkpoint
uv run eval_policy.py \
    --checkpoint "${ABC_CACHE:-cache}/bottles_75k.pt" \
    --num-worlds 1 --num-chunks 2 --no-fast-inference \
    --save-video --video-every-n-actions 15
```

The checkpoint includes its vision backbone and normalization statistics;
no separate DINO weight download is needed for this evaluation. The first
launch compiles MJWarp CUDA kernels (approximately one minute); download and
rollout times depend on your connection and GPU. This short run skips the
optional inference compilation.

Expect `summary.json` and a `world_*.mp4` video under
`outputs/sim_eval_put_plastic_bottles_in_bin/`. Completing the run checks
checkpoint loading, rendering, and policy inference. Two action chunks are
too short to measure task success; use the full [evaluation](#evaluation)
instructions for that.

## Training

First we need to download the requisite data (norm stats and either a sample or full data.)
```bash
uv run prepare.py            # preview (a few episodes of data, ~130MB)
uv run prepare.py --full     # all data for bottles in bin (~35GB)
uv run prepare.py --checkpoint  # add to also pull the pretrained 75k policy (~8.1GB)
uv run prepare.py --sim-data sim_spell_abc  # one sim task's episodes + its assets (--sim-data-list to browse)
```

This populates the cache dir (default `cache/`, or `ABC_CACHE` if set) with:

```
cache/
  norm_stats.json                       # state/action z-score stats
  train_real/episode_<uuid>/{states_actions.bin, combined_camera-images-rgb.mp4, episode_metadata.json}
  val_real/...
  train_sim/...
  val_sim/...
```

Set `ABC_CACHE=/path/to/cache` before running commands if you want the cache
outside the repository.

:warning: Note: `prepare.py` does not download DINO weights. Review and follow the DINO license terms, then download the weights from [Meta](https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/dinov3-downloads/) or [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/facebook/dinov3-vitb16-pretrain-lvd1689m). Save the file as `dinov3_vitb16_pretrain_lvd1689m.pth` in the cache dir. :warning:

### ABC-DiT Training

The command to run training is below. Note that this is for single node training with 8 GPUs, change `nproc-per-node` if you want.

```bash
uv run torchrun --standalone --nproc-per-node 8 train.py

# Resume from a local checkpoint, including optimizer/scheduler and data stream position.
uv run torchrun --standalone --nproc-per-node 8 train.py --resume-from cache/finetune_checkpoints/last.pt
```
The dataclass config is exposed as CLI flags; `uv run python train.py --help` shows training, optimizer, flow, CLIP asset, and model options. The default model config is the checkpoint-compatible ABC-DiT XL shape.

If you pulled with `--full` above, this checkpoint is expected to work for the bottles in bin task in both sim and real. The performance should be similar to [this](assets/bottles_real.mp4).

Training defaults in `abc_minimal/config.py` match the production reference finetune (lr 1e-4 with a 1k-step linear warmup, AdamW(0.9, 0.95), wd 0.01, grad clip 10, prefix conditioning max 8 with noise 0.05, 10% state masking, batch 90/GPU, 75k steps, hours-weighted 2-component mixture).

If you have fewer GPUs than 8 you need to reduce nproc per node or if you have less than 80Gb of VRAM you may need to reduce `--batch-size`.  The above training yields ~2.6-3 iterations / sec on H100/H200. It achieves a training loss of ~`0.048` after 75k steps.  The DiT policy also supports a CLIP ViT-B/16 vision backbone (in place of DINOv3) via `--model.vision-backbone clip`.

### ABC-VLA Training

A diffusion-only port of the Gemma 3 VLA: Gemma 3 4B with SigLIP at 224x224, one
selectable Gemma feature layer, QK-normalized learned-query pooling, a state token
plus optional direct state conditioning, and a small AdaLN DiT head. FAST tokens
and the alternative conditioners are not included. VLA training supports FSDP
with the restrictions described below.

Training from the Gemma base needs Google's `gemma_pytorch` checkpoint
(`google/gemma-3/pyTorch/gemma-3-4b-pt` on Kaggle, under the Gemma Terms of Use);
the Hugging Face format is not compatible. Select the policy with `--policy vla`:

```bash
uv run torchrun --standalone --nproc-per-node 8 train.py \
    --policy vla \
    --vla-model.backbone.checkpoint /path/to/gemma3_4b_pt.pt \
    --flow.num-diffusion-draws 4
```

The `--prompt.*` subtask and operator options apply to the VLA as to the DiT;
neither has been validated for it. `--fsdp` shards parameters, gradients, and
Adam state across the ranks instead of replicating them, roughly halving
per-GPU memory on two GPUs. Launch with `torchrun --nproc-per-node` greater
than 1; `--fsdp` is VLA-only and cannot be combined with `--compile-siglip`.

### Finetuning from a released checkpoint

To finetune from a released checkpoint instead of training from scratch, download the parent and pass `--load-pretrained` (fresh optimizer, step 0).

#### ABC-DiT Finetuning

```bash
# Pulls cache/abc_dit_xl_200k_model.pt (~8.1 GB)
uv run prepare.py --pretrained
uv run train.py --load-pretrained
```

`--pretrained-ckpt-name` picks the checkpoint file inside the cache dir (default
`abc_dit_xl_200k_model.pt`, which is what `--pretrained` downloads). Use
`--model.vision-backbone clip` when the parent is a CLIP-DiT checkpoint; DINOv3
is the default.

#### ABC-VLA Finetuning

The same weights-only path works for VLA checkpoints and needs no Gemma base:

```bash
uv run prepare.py --vla-pretrained

uv run train.py \
    --policy vla \
    --load-pretrained \
    --pretrained-ckpt-name vla_abc130k_200000_v2.pt
```

`--vla-pretrained` fetches the recommended `abc130k` step-200000 parent, verifies
its checksum, and installs the assets for its five sim tasks;
`--vla-pretrained-family {abc130k,200k}` and `--vla-pretrained-step
{50000,100000,200000}` select the others (the `200k` family trained on xdof only).
The v2 files embed norm stats and architecture metadata, which is checked against
the CLI config before strict loading; `--resume-from` is only for a stateful
continuation.

**Multi-node training, the episode data format, and prompt conditioning options
are documented in the [abc_minimal README](abc_minimal/README.md).**

## Viewing the Sim Data

To download and view particular tasks from the sim data, and visualise the episodes, use the following

```bash
uv run prepare.py --sim-data-list # list possible tasks
uv run prepare.py --sim-data conveyor_pick # download one from the list
uv run viz_episode.py --root cache/train_sim --port 8080 # visualise data
```

The replay modes (pose playback vs physics re-simulation) are described in the
[abc_minimal README](abc_minimal/README.md#visualizing-episodes-and-policies).

## Evaluation

`eval_policy.py` evaluates a checkpoint on the `abc_sim/` task catalogue: one
you trained yourself (`cache/finetune_checkpoints/last.pt`) or a released one:

```bash
# bottles_75k.pt: the 75k-step bottles-only policy, with norm_stats.json and the preview tar.
uv run prepare.py --checkpoint

# abc_dit_xl_200k_model.pt: the multi-task DiT parent.
uv run prepare.py --pretrained

# vla_abc130k_200000_v2.pt: the VLA parent, with its five tasks' assets.
uv run prepare.py --vla-pretrained

# A per-task finetune at its recommended step, sha-verified, with its eval command
# printed. --sim-checkpoint-list shows the catalogue with results;
# --sim-checkpoint-full-state fetches the ~24 GB training-state file instead.
uv run prepare.py --sim-checkpoint pour
```

Every download installs the sim assets its checkpoint needs and prints eval and
viewer commands. Both tools use the prompt each checkpoint trained under, so
`--sim.prompt` and `--sim.checkpoint` are only for overrides.

To watch a policy live in a viser window at `localhost:8080`, prepare its task
bundle once (the assets plus the recommended model-only checkpoint, no episode
data), then select the task in the viewer. Every task has a DiT bundle and a
`vla_` bundle; `--sim-bundle-list` shows all of them with their results, and
`--sim-force` refreshes a cached manifest:

```bash
uv run prepare.py --sim-bundle-list
uv run prepare.py --sim-bundle put_plastic_bottles_in_bin
uv run prepare.py --sim-bundle vla_lego_blocks_sorting
uv run viz_policy.py --sim.task put_plastic_bottles_in_bin --port 8080
```

![](assets/sim_eval.gif)

To run the evaluation, download the sim assets once (`uv run prepare.py --sim`;
the first launch also compiles MJWarp's CUDA kernels, ~1 min):

```bash
# 20 worlds, save a video of each rollout, log per-chunk progress.
uv run eval_policy.py \
    --checkpoint cache/bottles_75k.pt \
    --num-worlds 20 \
    --save-video --video-every-n-actions 15 --log-every-chunk

# Output: $REPO/outputs/sim_eval_put_plastic_bottles_in_bin/
#   summary.json     — success_rate, num_success, mean_reward,
#                      mean_max_progress, mean_max_bottles_in_bin
#   world_*.mp4      — per-world rollout videos (with --save-video)

# 100 worlds stepped together in MJWarp physics (see the abc_sim README).
uv run eval_policy.py \
    --checkpoint cache/bottles_75k.pt \
    --num-worlds 100 --parallel-worlds 100 \
    --randomization '{"bottle_count": 6, "randomize_variants": false, "randomize_scales": false}'
```

Any catalogue task is selected by name with `--task`. The task list, eval
flags, prompt defaults, and the released checkpoints' expected numbers are all
documented in the [abc_sim README](abc_sim/README.md#sim-eval).

## Real-robot deployment

The deployment stack, including RTC, teleoperation, and recording, is
documented in [`deploy/README.md`](deploy/README.md). Install its optional
hardware dependencies with `uv sync --extra deploy`.

## Episode exports & training data format

The quickstart real-data download covers the bottles task; simulation data for
additional tasks is available through `prepare.py --sim-data-list`. To prepare
other real-data tasks, the ABC-130k MCAPs are hosted on Hugging Face at
[`XDOF/ABC-130k`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/XDOF/ABC-130k) (the dataset
is gated, so accept access on the dataset page and set `HF_TOKEN`). Download
all MCAPs for one task and convert them in place:

```bash
uv run scripts/export_hf_task.py --task organize_the_condiment_bottles
```

The episode format the trainer reads, the local MCAP converter, multi-node
sharded downloads, and subtask/operator conditioning are documented in the
[abc_minimal README](abc_minimal/README.md#training-data).

## Licenses

The project code is Apache-2.0 ([`LICENSE`](LICENSE)), with third-party
components covered by the licenses listed below. The published DiT checkpoints
`bottles_75k.pt` and `abc_dit_xl_200k_model.pt` are Apache-2.0.
Both checkpoints embed a DINOv3-derived vision backbone, so the DINOv3 use
restrictions below apply to the weights as well as to the code that loads them.

The released VLA checkpoints (including `vla_abc130k_200000_v2.pt`, the
`abc130k` and `200k` families, and their task finetunes) contain Gemma-derived
weights and are subject to the [Gemma Terms of Use](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/terms),
including its use and redistribution conditions. See [Gemma weights terms of
use](#gemma-weights-terms-of-use) below.

### Gemma weights terms of use

Gemma model code is Apache-2.0, but Gemma *weights* are additionally governed by
the Google Gemma Terms of Use (https://ai.google.dev/gemma/terms), including its
Prohibited Use Policy. Training from the base Gemma 3 checkpoint requires a
user-supplied file; the base checkpoint is not bundled in this repository.
The released VLA checkpoints downloaded by `prepare.py` contain Gemma-derived
weights, so those terms also apply when finetuning or evaluating them without
a separate base checkpoint. See `assets/third_party/gemma/NOTICE` and the
[Gemma Terms of Use](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/terms) for details.

### Simulator asset licenses

The simulator asset packages installed by `prepare.py --sim` (and the RoboCasa
packs fetched by `--sim-robocasa`) bundle meshes and textures from the sources
below. abc-side processing — recentering, rescaling, trimesh re-export, resized
textures, custom convex collision decompositions, and retuned MJCF wrappers —
does not change the upstream licenses. Per-object credits ship inside the
packages where noted.

### DINOv3 use restrictions

The DINOv3 License prohibits use of the DINO Materials (including weights and
derivatives) for: military purposes; activities subject to ITAR or other
export-control regimes covering defense articles; nuclear applications;
espionage; and the development, manufacture, or use of weapons. Downstream
users who load DINOv3 weights through this codebase are bound by these
restrictions; see `assets/third_party/dinov3/LICENSE.md` for the full
